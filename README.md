## Setup & Run

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
   cd kyc-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```

3. **Configure API URL**

   - By default, the frontend expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:8080`.
   - If your backend is running elsewhere, edit `app/services/api.ts` and update the `API_BASE_URL`.

4. **Run the app**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Usage**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
   - Login, fill out the KYC form, upload files, and manage transactions.

## Important: Backend Integration

- **The backend must be running** for the frontend to function fully.
- See the backend README for setup instructions.
